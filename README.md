# 👋 Hi Samarth here!

## 🧑 About me:

A **product designer** currently working at `Paytm Insider` who is keen on **illustrations**, **animations** and obviously **user experience design**. Who has sudden urges to **develop random web applications**. You can learn more about me at [my website 📱](https://samarthnayyar.com).

## 📖 My Story:

Ever since childhood, I have had the creative side in me, from drawing on walls to always find ways to spill and make a "creative" mess on the floor. Joined engineering just like any standard Indian boy, realized it's not for me in a year. Having the fighting spirit and the well to no disappoint people who wanted me to be an engineer I completed it but made sure I had a plan right after. 

__From an engineering background, growing through communities and paving my way into the product design domain I turned into the person I am today. A self taught product designer.__
